# Robotics
This project consists of showing and disseminating the code for the creation and use of robots in matlab and sharing it with the teacher via the website.
This site is a simple html where we use bootstrap as a frontend framework.
The robots we will talk about in this project are: Cobra600 and PhantomX.

On navbar we can get more information about the project, as well as download the zip that contains the code.

There are two tabs, one for Cobra600 and one for PhantomX, in both it is shown:
the poses as well as the parameters used,
the qz animations for each of the others (plus an extra),
a GUI, which consists of a gif that shows the use of the robot's teach function,
and a code tab that shows the matlab code used.
